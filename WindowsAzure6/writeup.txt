For this assignment, I started off by transferring all my files into one Visual Studio project, and then started to link the previous
three programming assignments together. For PA1, I utilized JSONP because it was a cross domain request, and tried to display the player stats
below the search bar. I modified my result.php code from PA1 to have it display a JSON array of the player's data. Afterwards, I incorporated my 
query suggestions by utilizing jQuery Autocomplete and inserting my trie results into array. My searches yield the correct suggestions, but for some reason, 
the results aren't aligned right below my search bar. They appear on the right-most edge of the page, but the suggestions are still visible. 
I debugged the trie suggestions to ensure that it was returning the correct results. For the monetization part, I placed my Qadabra ad at the bottom of the page.
I wrote my code using C# best practices, and I published my Visual Studio project onto Azure.
